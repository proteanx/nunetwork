MOTION TO TERMINATE THE CURRENT CHIEF OF LIQUIDITY OPERATIONS (FORUM NAME @PHOENIX)

This motion would officially terminate @Phoenix as Chief of Liquidity Operations.

This motion does not elect anyone to replace @Phoenix.

Enforcement of this motion includes @Phoenix surrendering any remaining NuNetwork assets still in his possession or control including but not limited to digital currencies, account logins, information related to services rendered for Nu & and/or any other information considered pertinent to NuNetwork liquidity operations; to @jooize or another existing trusted NuNetwork custodian.

Liquidity operations continue in its current state without a Chief of Liquidity Operations until a new Chief is elected via motion or until shareholders establish a new authority hierarchy via motion.
